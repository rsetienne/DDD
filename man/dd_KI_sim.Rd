\title{Function to simulate a key innovation in macro-evolution with the innovative
clade decoupling from the diversity-dependent diversification dynamics of
the main clade}
\usage{
dd_KI_sim(pars, age, ddmodel = 1, plotit = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{Vector of parameters: \cr \cr \code{pars[1]} corresponds to
lambda_M (speciation rate of the main clade) \cr \code{pars[2]} corresponds
to mu_M (extinction rate of the main clade) \cr \code{pars[3]} corresponds
to K_M (clade-level carrying capacity of the main clade) \code{pars[4]}
corresponds to lambda_S (speciation rate of the subclade) \cr \code{pars[5]}
corresponds to mu_S (extinction rate of the subclade) \cr \code{pars[5]}
corresponds to K_S (clade-level carrying capacity of the subclade) \cr
\code{pars[7]} tinn, the time the shift in rates occurs in the lineage
leading to the subclade}

\item{age}{Sets the crown age for the simulation}

\item{ddmodel}{Sets the model of diversity-dependence: \cr \code{ddmodel ==
1} : linear dependence in speciation rate with parameter K (= diversity
where speciation = extinction)\cr \code{ddmodel == 1.3} : linear dependence
in speciation rate with parameter K' (= diversity where speciation = 0)\cr
\code{ddmodel == 2} : exponential dependence in speciation rate with
parameter K (= diversity where speciation = extinction)\cr \code{ddmodel ==
2.1} : variant of exponential dependence in speciation rate with offset at
infinity\cr \code{ddmodel == 2.2} : 1/n dependence in speciation rate\cr
\code{ddmodel == 2.3} : exponential dependence in speciation rate with
parameter x (= exponent)\cr \code{ddmodel == 3} : linear dependence in
extinction rate \cr \code{ddmodel == 4} : exponential dependence in
extinction rate \cr \code{ddmodel == 4.1} : variant of exponential
dependence in extinction rate with offset at infinity \cr \code{ddmodel ==
4.2} : 1/n dependence in extinction rate with offset at infinity}

\item{plotit}{Logical, \code{TRUE} if plot should be produced.}
}
\value{
\item{ out }{ A list with the following elements: The first element
is the tree of extant species in phylo format \cr The second element is the
tree of all species, including extinct species, in phylo format \cr The
third element is a matrix of all species where \cr - the first column is the
time at which a species is born \cr - the second column is the label of the
parent of the species; positive and negative values only indicate whether
the species belongs to the left or right crown lineage \cr - the third
column is the label of the daughter species itself; positive and negative
values only indicate whether the species belongs to the left or right crown
lineage \cr - the fourth column is the time of extinction of the species \cr
If the fourth element equals -1, then the species is still extant.\cr - the
fifth column indicates whether the species belong to the main clade (0) or
the subclade (1)\cr The fourth element is the subclade tree of extant
species (without stem) \cr The fifth element is the subclade tree of all
species (without stem) \cr The sixth element is the same as the first,
except that it has attributed 0 for the main clade and 1 for the subclade\cr
The seventh element is the same as the Second, except that it has attributed
0 for the main clade and 1 for the subclade\cr The sixth and seventh element
will be NULL if the subclade does not exist (because it went extinct).  }

Simulating a diversity-dependent diversification process where at a given
time a new clade emerges with different inherent speciation rate and
extinction rate and clade-level carrying capacity and with decoupled
dynamics
